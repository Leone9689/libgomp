ABOUT

	This repository contains an enhanced implementation of LibGOMP,
	which features the following extras:
	
		* The Smart Round-Robin (SRR) loop scheduler

		* The Bin Packing LPT (BinLPT) loop scheduler

	Furthermore, we ship a synthetic kernel that can be used to
	benchmark loop schedulers.

BUILDING

	To build LaPeSD LibGOMP execute the following commands in the root
	directory of the project:
	
		$ make libgomp-srr        # Build LibGOMP with SRR scheduler.
		$ make libgomp-adaptive   # Build LibGOMP with adaptive scheduler.
		$ make                    # Build synthetic kernel.
